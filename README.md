## Project Overview

This front-end application serves as the central hub for our DAO community. Members can:

- **Connect their wallets** to authenticate and interact with the platform.
- **View a personalized dashboard** with key information like token balance, contribution score, and notifications.
- **Participate in governance** by viewing and voting on proposals.
- **Track and manage tasks** within the DAO.
- **Monitor the DAO's treasury** and recent transactions.
- **Access administrative functions** (for designated roles).

The goal is to create a transparent, user-friendly interface that empowers our community to actively participate in the DAO's decision-making processes and overall management.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project up and running.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js:** (Recommended version >= 18) - You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm** or **yarn:** Package managers for JavaScript. npm comes bundled with Node.js. You can install yarn from [yarnpkg.com](https://yarnpkg.com/).
- **Git:** A distributed version control system. You likely already have it, but if not, you can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

### Cloning the Repository

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.
3. Run the following command to clone the repository:

   git clone <repository_url>


   *(Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of this repository)*

### Installation

1. After cloning the repository, navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd <repository_name>
   ```

   *(Replace `<repository_name>` with the name of the cloned repository)*

2. Install the project dependencies using either npm or yarn:

npm run dev
```

**Using yarn:**

```bash
yarn dev
```

This command will start the Next.js development server. You can then view the application in your web browser by navigating to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Testing and Development

[TODO] - Information about testing procedures and development workflows using feature branches will be updated soon.
